@article{Loessner2013,
abstract = {Computational models represent a highly suitable framework, not only for testing biological hypotheses and generating new ones but also for optimising experimental strategies. As one surveys the literature devoted to cancer modelling, it is obvious that immense progress has been made in applying simulation techniques to the study of cancer biology, although the full impact has yet to be realised. For example, there are excellent models to describe cancer incidence rates or factors for early disease detection, but these predictions are unable to explain the functional and molecular changes that are associated with tumour progression. In addition, it is crucial that interactions between mechanical effects, and intracellular and intercellular signalling are incorporated in order to understand cancer growth, its interaction with the extracellular microenvironment and invasion of secondary sites. There is a compelling need to tailor new, physiologically relevant in silico models that are specialised for particular types of cancer, such as ovarian cancer owing to its unique route of metastasis, which are capable of investigating anti-cancer therapies, and generating both qualitative and quantitative predictions. This Commentary will focus on how computational simulation approaches can advance our understanding of ovarian cancer progression and treatment, in particular, with the help of multicellular cancer spheroids, and thus, can inform biological hypothesis and experimental design.},

@article{Manoussaki1996,
abstract = {Endothelial cells, when cultured on gelled basement membrane matrix exert forces of tension through which they deform the matrix and at the same time they aggregate into clusters. The cells eventually form a network of cord-like structures connecting cell aggregates. In this network, almost all of the matrix has been pulled underneath the cell cords and cell clusters. This phenomenon has been proposed as a possible model for the growth and development of planar vascular systems in vitro. Our hypothesis is that the matrix is reorganized and the cellular networks form as a result of traction forces exerted by the cells on the matrix and the latter's elasticity. We construct and analyze a mathematical model based on this hypothesis and examine conditions necessary for the formation of the pattern. We show cell migration is not necessary for pattern formation and that isotropic, strain-stimulated traction is sufficient to form the observed patterns.},

@article{Paparcone2010,
abstract = {In addition to being associated with severe degenerative diseases, amyloids show exceptional mechanical properties including great strength, sturdiness and elasticity. However, thus far physical models that explain these properties remain elusive, and our understanding of molecular deformation and failure mechanisms of individual amyloid fibrils is limited. Here we report a series of molecular dynamics simulations, carried out to analyze the mechanical response of two-fold symmetric AΒ(1-40) amyloid fibrils, twisted protein nanofilaments consisting of a H-bonded layered structure. We find a correlation of the mechanical behavior with chemical and nanostructural rearrangements of the fibril during compressive and tensile deformation, showing that the density of H-bonds varies linearly with the measured strain. Further, we find that both compressive and tensile deformation is coupled with torsional deformation, which is manifested in a strong variation of the interlayer twist angle that is found to be proportional to both the applied stress and measured strain. In both compression and tension we observe an increase of the Young's modulus from 2.34. GPa (for less than 0.1{\%} strain in compression and 0.2{\%} strain in tension), to 12.43. GPa for compression and 18.05. GPa for tension. The moduli at larger deformation are in good agreement with experimental data, where values in the range of 10-20. GPa have been reported. Our studies confirm that amyloids feature a very high stiffness, and elucidate the importance of the chemical and structural rearrangements of the fibrils during deformation. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.},

@article{Fogelson1984,
abstract = {The repair of small blood vessels and the pathological growth of internal blood clots involve the formation of platelet aggregates adhering to portions of the vessel wall. Our microscopic model represents blood by a suspension of discrete massless platelets in a viscous incompressible fluid. Platelets are initially noncohesive; however, if stimulated by an above-threshold concentration of the chemical ADP or by contact with the adhesive injured region of the vessel wall, they become cohesive and secrete more ADP into the fluid. Cohesion between platelets and adhesion of a platelet to the injured wall are modeled by creating elastic links. Repulsive forces prevent a platelet from coming too close to another platelet or to the wall. The forces affect the fluid motion in the neighborhood of an aggregate. The platelets and secreted ADP both move by fluid advection and diffusion. The equations of the model are studied numerically in two dimensions. The platelet forces are calculated implicitly by minimizing a nonlinear energy function. Our minimization scheme merges Gill and Murray's (Math. Programming 7 (1974), 311) modified Newton's method with elements of the Yale sparse matrix package. The stream-function' formulation' of the Stokes' equations for the fluid motion under the influence of platelet forces is solved using Bjorstad's biharmonic solver ("Numerical Solution of the Biharmonic Equation," Ph. D. Thesis, Stanford University, 1980). The ADP transport equation is solved with an alternating-direction implicit scheme. A linked-list data structure is introduced to keep track of changing platelet states and changing configurations of interplatelet links. Results of calculations with healthy platelets and with diseased platelets are presented. {\textcopyright} 1984.},

It is used to determine the total force exerted on the membrane at each position along the leading edge and at each time step. The model reproduces the marked state switches in protrusion morphodynamics found experimentally between epithelial cells in control conditions and cells expressing constitutively active Rac, a signaling molecule involved in the regulation of lamellipodium network assembly. The model also suggests a mechanistic explanation of experimental distortions in protrusion morphodynamics induced by deregulation of Arp2/3 and cofilin activity. {\textcopyright} 2010 by the Biophysical Society.},

abstract = {Platelet-driven blood clot contraction (retraction) is thought to promote wound closure and secure hemostasis while preventing vascular occlusion. Notwithstanding its importance, clot contraction remains a poorly understood process, partially because of the lack of methodology to quantify its dynamics and requirements. We used a novel automated optical analyzer to continuously track in vitro changes in the size of contracting clots in whole blood and in variously reconstituted samples. Kinetics of contraction was complemented with dynamic rheometry to characterize the viscoelasticity of contracting clots. This combined approach enabled investigation of the coordinated mechanistic impact of platelets, including nonmuscle myosin II, red blood cells (RBCs), fibrin(ogen), factor XIIIa (FXIIIa), and thrombin on the kinetics and mechanics of the contraction process. Clot contraction is composed of 3 sequential phases, each characterized by a distinct rate constant. Thrombin, Ca(2+), the integrin $\alpha$IIb$\beta$3, myosin IIa, FXIIIa cross-linking, and platelet count all promote 1 or more phases of the clot contraction process. In contrast, RBCs impair contraction and reduce elasticity, while increasing the overall contractile stress generated by the platelet-fibrin meshwork. A better understanding of the mechanisms by which blood cells, fibrin(ogen), and platelet-fibrin interactions modulate clot contraction may generate novel approaches to reveal and to manage thrombosis and hemostatic disorders.},

abstract = {As animals develop, tissue bending contributes to shape the initial simple planar epithelia of embryos into complex three-dimensional structures. However, the architecture and packing of curved epithelia remains largely unknown. Here, we show by means of mathematical modelling that cells in bent epithelia can undergo intercalations along the apico-basal axis. This phenomenon forces cells to have different neighbours in their basal and apical surfaces. As a consequence, epithelial cells adopt a novel shape that we term “scutoid”. The detailed analysis of diverse tissues confirms that generation of apico-basal intercalations between cells is a common feature during morphogenesis. Using biophysical arguments, we propose that scutoids make possible the minimization of the tissue energy and stabilize three-dimensional packing. Hence, we conclude that scutoids are nature´s solution to achieve epithelial bending. Our findings pave the way to understand the three-dimensional organization of epithelial organs.},

@article{Marino2008,
abstract = {Accuracy of results from mathematical and computer models of biological systems is often complicated by the presence of uncertainties in experimental data that are used to estimate parameter values. Current mathematical modeling approaches typically use either single-parameter or local sensitivity analyses. However, these methods do not accurately assess uncertainty and sensitivity in the system as, by default, they hold all other parameters fixed at baseline values. Using techniques described within we demonstrate how a multi-dimensional parameter space can be studied globally so all uncertainties can be identified. Further, uncertainty and sensitivity analysis techniques can help to identify and ultimately control uncertainties. In this work we develop methods for applying existing analytical tools to perform analyses on a variety of mathematical and computer models. We compare two specific types of global sensitivity analysis indexes that have proven to be among the most robust and efficient. Through familiar and new examples of mathematical and computer models, we provide a complete methodology for performing these analyses, in both deterministic and stochastic settings, and propose novel techniques to handle problems encountered during these types of analyses. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

@article{Zandi2003,
abstract = {We study the dynamics of the passage of a stiff chain through a pore into a cell containing particles that bind reversibly to it. Using Brownian molecular dynamics simulations we investigate the mean first-passage time as a function of the length of the chain inside for different concentrations of binding particles. As a consequence of the interactions with these particles, the chain experiences a net force along its length whose calculated value from the simulations accounts for the velocity at which it enters the cell. This force can in turn be obtained from the solution of a generalized diffusion equation incorporating an effective Langmuir adsorption free energy for the chain plus binding particles. These results suggest a role of binding particles in the translocation process that is in general quite different from that of a Brownian ratchet. Furthermore, nonequilibrium effects contribute significantly to the dynamics; e.g., the chain often enters the cell faster than particle binding can be saturated, resulting in a force several times smaller than the equilibrium value.},

abstract = {Thromboembolic disease is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. In the last several years there have been a number of studies attempting to identify mechanisms that stop thrombus growth. This paper identifies a novel mechanism related to formation of a fibrin cap. In particular, protein transport through a fibrin network, an important component of a thrombus, was studied by integrating experiments with model simulations. The network permeability and the protein diffusivity were shown to be important factors determining the transport of proteins through the fibrin network. Our previous in vivo studies in mice have shown that stabilized non-occluding thrombi are covered by a fibrin network ('fibrin cap'). Model simulations, calibrated using experiments in microfluidic devices and accounting for the permeable structure of the fibrin cap, demonstrated that thrombin generated inside the thrombus was washed downstream through the fibrin network, thus limiting exposure of platelets on the thrombus surface to thrombin. Moreover, by restricting the approach of resting platelets in the flowing blood to the thrombus core, the fibrin cap impaired platelets from reaching regions of high thrombin concentration necessary for platelet activation and limited thrombus growth. The formation of a fibrin cap prevents small thrombi that frequently develop in the absence of major injury in the 60000 km of vessels in the body from developing into life threatening events.},

abstract = {The actomyosin cytoskeleton is a primary force-generating mechanism in morphogenesis, thus a robust spatial control of cytoskeletal positioning is essential. In this report, we demonstrate that actomyosin contractility and planar cell polarity (PCP) interact in post-mitotic Ciona notochord cells to self-assemble and reposition actomyosin rings, which play an essential role for cell elongation. Intriguingly, rings always form at the cells' anterior edge before migrating towards the center as contractility increases, reflecting a novel dynamical property of the cortex. Our drug and genetic manipulations uncover a tug-of-war between contractility, which localizes cortical flows toward the equator and PCP, which tries to reposition them. We develop a simple model of the physical forces underlying this tug-of-war, which quantitatively reproduces our results. We thus propose a quantitative framework for dissecting the relative contribution of contractility and PCP to the self-assembly and repositioning of cytoskeletal structures, which should be applicable to other morphogenetic events.},

abstract = {In this article, a new set of parameters compatible with the dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) force field is developed for phospholipids. The coarse-grained (CG) models of these molecules are constructed by mapping four heavy atoms and their attached hydrogen atoms to one bead. The beads are divided into types distinguished by charge type, polarizability, and hydrogen-bonding capacity. First, we derive the relationship between the DPD repulsive force and Flory-Huggins $\chi$-parameters based on this four-to-one CG mapping scheme. Then, we optimize the DPD force parameters for phospholipids. The feasibility of this model is demonstrated by simulating the structural and thermodynamic properties of lipid bilayer membranes, including the membrane thickness, the area per lipid, the lipid tail orientation, the bending rigidity, the rupture behavior, and the potential of mean force for lipid flip-flop.},

abstract = {Peto's paradox is the lack of the expected trend in cancer incidence as a function of body size and lifespan across species. The leading hypothesis to explain this pattern is natural selection for differential cancer prevention in larger, longer lived species. We evaluate whether a similar effect exists within species, specifically humans. We begin by reanalysing a recently published dataset to separate the effects of stem cell number and replication rate, and show that each has an independent effect on cancer risk. When considering the lifetime number of stem cell divisions in an extended dataset, and removing cases associated with other diseases or carcinogens, we find that lifetime cancer risk per tissue saturates at approximately 0.3-1.3{\%} for the types considered. We further demonstrate that grouping by anatomical site explains most of the remaining variation. Our results indicate that cancer risk depends not only on the number of stem cell divisions but varies enormously (approx. 10 000 times) depending on anatomical site. We conclude that variation in risk of human cancer types is analogous to the paradoxical lack of variation in cancer incidence among animal species and may likewise be understood as a result of evolution by natural selection.},

abstract = {During wound healing and angiogenesis, fibrin serves as a provisional extracellular matrix. We use a model system of fibroblasts embedded in fibrin gels to study how cell-mediated contraction may influence the macroscopic mechanical properties of their extracellular matrix during such processes. We demonstrate by macroscopic shear rheology that the cells increase the elastic modulus of the fibrin gels. Microscopy observations show that this stiffening sets in when the cells spread and apply traction forces on the fibrin fibers. We further show that the stiffening response mimics the effect of an external stress applied by mechanical shear. We propose that stiffening is a consequence of active myosin-driven cell contraction, which provokes a nonlinear elastic response of the fibrin matrix. Cell-induced stiffening is limited to a factor 3 even though fibrin gels can in principle stiffen much more before breaking. We discuss this observation in light of recent models of fibrin gel elasticity, and conclude that the fibroblasts pull out floppy modes, such as thermal bending undulations, from the fibrin network, but do not axially stretch the fibers. Our findings are relevant for understanding the role of matrix contraction by cells during wound healing and cancer development, and may provide design parameters for materials to guide morphogenesis in tissue engineering. {\textcopyright} 2013 Biophysical Society.},

abstract = {The systems analysis of thrombosis seeks to quantitatively predict blood function in a given vascular wall and hemodynamic context. Relevant to both venous and arterial thrombosis, a Blood Systems Biology approach should provide metrics for rate and molecular mechanisms of clot growth, thrombotic risk, pharmacological response, and utility of new therapeutic targets. As a rapidly created multicellular aggregate with a polymerized fibrin matrix, blood clots result from hundreds of unique reactions within and around platelets propagating in space and time under hemodynamic conditions. Coronary artery thrombosis is dominated by atherosclerotic plaque rupture, complex pulsatile flows through stenotic regions producing high wall shear stresses, and plaque-derived tissue factor driving thrombin production. In contrast, venous thrombosis is dominated by stasis or depressed flows, endothelial inflammation, white blood cell-derived tissue factor, and ample red blood cell incorporation. By imaging vessels, patient-specific assessment using computational fluid dynamics provides an estimate of local hemodynamics and fractional flow reserve. High-dimensional ex vivo phenotyping of platelet and coagulation can now power multiscale computer simulations at the subcellular to cellular to whole vessel scale of heart attacks or strokes. In addition, an integrated systems biology approach can rank safety and efficacy metrics of various pharmacological interventions or clinical trial designs.},

abstract = {Fibrin is a protein polymer that forms the viscoelastic scaffold of blood clots and thrombi. Despite the critical importance of fibrin deformability for outcomes of bleeding and thrombosis, the structural origins of the clot's elasticity and plasticity remain largely unknown. However, there is substantial evidence that unfolding of fibrin is an important part of the mechanism. We used Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy to reveal force-induced changes in the secondary structure of hydrated fibrin clots made of human blood plasma in vitro. When extended or compressed, fibrin showed a shift of absorbance intensity mainly in the amide I band (1600-1700 cm-1) as well as in the amide II and III bands, indicating an increase of the $\beta$-sheets and a corresponding reduction of the $\alpha$-helices. The structural conversions correlated directly with the strain or pressure and were partially reversible at the conditions applied. The additional absorbance observed at 1612-1624 cm -1 was characteristic of the nascent interchain $\beta$-sheets, consistent with protein aggregation and fiber bundling during clot deformation observed using scanning electron microscopy. We conclude that under extension and/or compression an $\alpha$-helix to $\beta$-sheet conversion of the coiled-coils occurs in the fibrin clot as a part of forced protein unfolding. {\textcopyright} 2012 Biophysical Society.},

abstract = {During innate immune responses, the inflammatory CC chemokine receptors CCR1, CCR2, and CCR5 mediate the recruitment of blood monocytes to infected tissues by promoting cell migration in response to chemokines CCL2-5. Toll-like receptors also play an essential role, allowing pathogen recognition by the recruited monocytes. Here, we demonstrate that Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) stimulation by lipoteichoic acid (LTA) from Staphylococcus aureus leads to gradual down-modulation of CCR1, CCR2, and CCR5 from the plasma membrane of human blood-isolated monocytes and inhibits chemotaxis. Interestingly, LTA does not promote rapid desensitization of chemokine-mediated calcium responses. We found that the TLR2 crosstalk with chemokine receptors is not dependent on the Toll/interleukin-1 receptor domain-containing adaptor protein, but instead involves phospholipase C, the small G protein Rac1, and is phorbol ester sensitive. Activation of this pathway by LTA lead to $\beta$-arrestin– mediated endocytosis of Ser349-phosphorylated CCR5 into recycling endosomes, as does CCL5 treatment. However, LTA-induced internalization of CCR5 is a slower process associated with phospholipase C–mediated and phorbol ester–sensitive phosphorylation. Overall, our data indicate that TLR2 negatively regulates CCR1, CCR2, and CCR5 on human blood monocytes by activating the machinery used to support chemokine-dependent down- modulation and provide a molecular mechanism for inhibiting monocyte migration after pathogen recognition.},

abstract = {A multiscale formulation is derived for the mechanics of a dilute fiber network microstructure, as occurs in in vitro reconstituted collagen gels, to accommodate the deterministic solution of a uniform-stress condition in the fiber network. The macroscale two-phase equations are derived based on the integral volume-averaging approach of the spatial averaging theorem, modified for the averaging volume to deform materially in the solid phase and thereby ensuring consistent network mass conservation. For low-Reynolds-number fiber-fluid interaction with no hydrodynamic interaction between fibers, the macroscale Darcy law arises naturally as a function of average fiber orientation and volume fraction, with no additional empirical specification. The macroscale equations are solved using finite element analysis with the averaging volumes centered at Gauss points of integration. The macroscale solid stress and fluid velocity are obtained by microscale deterministic solution of network and Stokesian mechanics within the averaging volume at each Gauss point, whereas the macroscale displacements and fluid pressure are solved as interpolated finite element field variables. The theory when applied to describe confined compression of collagen gels reproduced the strain-rate dependent behavior observed in poroelastic materials. The deformation of the averaging region and the reorientation of the collagen network in response to strain are also discussed.},

abstract = {Cancer cell invasion from primary tumors is mediated by a complex interplay between cellular adhesions, actomyosin-driven contractility, and the physical characteristics of the extracellular matrix (ECM). Here, we incorporate a mechanochemical free-energy–based approach to elucidate how the two-way feedback loop between cell contractility (induced by the activity of chemomechanical interactions such as Ca2+ and Rho signaling pathways) and matrix fiber realignment and strain stiffening enables the cells to polarize and develop contractile forces to break free from the tumor spheroids and invade into the ECM. Interestingly, through this computational model, we are able to identify a critical stiffness that is required by the matrix to break intercellular adhesions and initiate cell invasion. Also, by considering the kinetics of the cell movement, our model predicts a biphasic invasiveness with respect to the stiffness of the matrix. These predictions are validated by analyzing the invasion of melanoma cells in collagen matrices of varying concentration. Our model also predicts a positive correlation between the elongated morphology of the invading cells and the alignment of fibers in the matrix, suggesting that cell polarization is directly proportional to the stiffness and alignment of the matrix. In contrast, cells in nonfibrous matrices are found to be rounded and not polarized, underscoring the key role played by the nonlinear mechanics of fibrous matrices. Importantly, our model shows that mechanical principles mediated by the contractility of the cells and the nonlinearity of the ECM behavior play a crucial role in determining the phenotype of the cell invasion.},

abstract = {Fibrinogen binding to the integrin $\alpha$IIb$\beta$3 mediates platelet aggregation and spreading on fibrinogen-coated surfaces. However, in vivo $\alpha$IIb$\beta$3 activation and fibrinogen conversion to fibrin occur simultaneously, although the relative contributions of fibrinogen versus fibrin to $\alpha$IIb$\beta$3-mediated platelet functions are unknown. Here, we compared the interaction of $\alpha$IIb$\beta$3 with fibrin and fibrinogen to explore their differential effects. A microscopic bead coated with fibrinogen or monomeric fibrin produced by treating the immobilized fibrinogen with thrombin was captured by a laser beam and repeatedly brought into contact with surface-attached purified $\alpha$IIb$\beta$3. When $\alpha$IIb$\beta$3-ligand complexes were detected, the rupture forces were measured and displayed as force histograms. Monomeric fibrin displayed a higher probability of interacting with $\alpha$IIb$\beta$3 and a greater binding strength. $\alpha$IIb$\beta$3-fibrin interactions were also less sensitive to inhibition by abciximab and eptifibatide. Both fibrinogen-and fibrin-$\alpha$IIb$\beta$3 interactions were partially inhibited by RGD peptides, suggesting the existence of common RGD-containing binding motifs. This assumption was supported using the fibrin variants $\alpha$D97E or $\alpha$D574E with mutated RGD motifs. Fibrin made from a fibrinogen$\gamma$$\gamma$ariant lacking the $\gamma$C $\alpha$IIb$\beta$3-binding motif was more reactive with $\alpha$IIb$\beta$3 than the parent fibrinogen. These results demonstrate that fibrin is more reactive with $\alpha$IIb$\beta$3 than fibrinogen. Fibrin is also less sensitive to $\alpha$IIb$\beta$3 inhibitors, suggesting that fibrin and fibrinogen have distinct binding requirements. In particular, the maintenance of $\alpha$IIb$\beta$3-binding activity in the absence of the $\gamma$C-dodecapeptide and the $\alpha$-chain RGD sequences suggests that the $\alpha$IIb$\beta$3-binding sites in fibrin are not confined to its known $\gamma$-chain and RGD motifs.},

abstract = {We developed a multiscale particle-based model of platelets, to study the transport dynamics of shear stresses between the surrounding fluid and the platelet membrane. This model facilitates a more accurate prediction of the activation potential of platelets by viscous shear stresses - one of the major mechanisms leading to thrombus formation in cardiovascular diseases and in prosthetic cardiovascular devices. The interface of the model couples coarse-grained molecular dynamics (CGMD) with dissipative particle dynamics (DPD). The CGMD handles individual platelets while the DPD models the macroscopic transport of blood plasma in vessels. A hybrid force field is formulated for establishing a functional interface between the platelet membrane and the surrounding fluid, in which the microstructural changes of platelets may respond to the extracellular viscous shear stresses transferred to them. The interaction between the two systems preserves dynamic properties of the flowing platelets, such as the flipping motion. Using this multiscale particle-based approach, we have further studied the effects of the platelet elastic modulus by comparing the action of the flow-induced shear stresses on rigid and deformable platelet models. The results indicate that neglecting the platelet deformability may overestimate the stress on the platelet membrane, which in turn may lead to erroneous predictions of the platelet activation under viscous shear flow conditions. This particle-based fluid-structure interaction multiscale model offers for the first time a computationally feasible approach for simulating deformable platelets interacting with viscous blood flow, aimed at predicting flow induced platelet activation by using a highly resolved mapping of the stress distribution on the platelet membrane under dynamic flow conditions.},

abstract = {In addition to their obvious biological roles in tissue function, cells often play a signifi-cant mechanical role through a combination of passive and active behaviors. This study focused on the passive mechanical contribution of cells in tissues by improving our multiscale model via the addition of cells, which were treated as dilute spherical inclusions. The first set of simulations considered a rigid cell, with the surrounding ECM modeled as (1) linear elastic, (2) Neo-Hookean, and (3) a fiber network. Comparison with the classical composite theory for rigid inclusions showed close agreement at low cell volume fraction. The fiber network case exhibited nonlinear stress–strain behavior and Poisson's ratios larger than the elastic limit of 0.5, characteristics similar to those of biological tissues. The second set of simulations used a fiber network for both the cell (simulating cytoskeletal filaments) and matrix, and investigated the effect of varying rela-tive stiffness between the cell and matrix, as well as the effect of a cytoplasmic pressure to enforce incompressibility of the cell. Results showed that the ECM network exerted negligible compression on the cell, even when the stiffness of fibers in the network was increased relative to the cell. Introduction of a cytoplasmic pressure significantly increased the stresses in the cell filament network, and altered how the cell changed its shape under tension. Findings from this study have implications on understanding how cells interact with their surrounding ECM, as well as in the context of mechanosensation.},

abstract = {Uncontrolled growth in a confined space generates mechanical compressive stress within tumors, but little is known about how such stress affects tumor cell behavior. Here we show that compressive stress stimulates migration of mammary carcinoma cells. The enhanced migration is accomplished by a subset of "leader cells" that extend filopodia at the leading edge of the cell sheet. Formation of these leader cells is dependent on cell microorganization and is enhanced by compressive stress. Accompanied by fibronectin deposition and stronger cell-matrix adhesion, the transition to leader-cell phenotype results in stabilization of persistent actomyosin-independent cell extensions and coordinated migration. Our results suggest that compressive stress accumulated during tumor growth can enable coordinated migration of cancer cells by stimulating formation of leader cells and enhancing cell-substrate adhesion. This novel mechanism represents a potential target for the prevention of cancer cell migration and invasion.},

abstract = {We developed a phenomenological three-dimensional platelet model to characterize  the filopodia formation observed during early stage platelet activation. Departing from continuum mechanics based approaches, this coarse-grained molecular dynamics (CGMD) particle-based model can deform to emulate the complex shape change and filopodia formation that platelets undergo during activation. The platelet peripheral zone is modeled with a two-layer homogeneous elastic structure represented by spring-connected particles. The structural zone is represented by a cytoskeletal assembly comprising of a filamentous core and filament bundles supporting the platelet's discoid shape, also modeled by spring-connected particles. The interior organelle zone is modeled by homogeneous cytoplasm particles that facilitate the platelet deformation. Nonbonded interactions among the discrete particles of the membrane, the cytoskeletal assembly, and the cytoplasm are described using the Lennard-Jones potential with empirical constants. By exploring the parameter space of this CGMD model, we have successfully simulated the dynamics of varied filopodia formations. Comparative analyses of length and thickness of filopodia show that our numerical simulations are in agreement with experimental measurements of flow-induced activated platelets.

Motility dysfunctions are involved in several life-threatening pathologies such as cancer and metastasis. Motile cells are also a natural realisation of active, self-propelled ‘particles', a popular research topic in nonequilibrium physics. Finally, from the materials perspective, assemblies of motile cells and evolving tissues constitute a class of adaptive self-healing materials that respond to the topography, elasticity and surface chemistry of the environment and react to external stimuli. Although a comprehensive understanding of substrate-based cell motility remains elusive, progress has been achieved recently in its modelling on the whole-cell level. Here we survey the most recent advances in computational approaches to cell movement and demonstrate how these models improve our understanding of complex self-organised systems such as living cells. npj},

abstract = {We developed a multiple time-stepping (MTS) algorithm for multiscale modeling of the dynamics of platelets flowing in viscous blood plasma. This MTS algorithm improves considerably the computational efficiency without significant loss of accuracy. This study of the dynamic properties of flowing platelets employs a combination of the dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) and the coarse-grained molecular dynamics (CGMD) methods to describe the dynamic microstructures of deformable platelets in response to extracellular flow-induced stresses. The disparate spatial scales between the two methods are handled by a hybrid force field interface. However, the disparity in temporal scales between the DPD and CGMD that requires time stepping at microseconds and nanoseconds respectively, represents a computational challenge that may become prohibitive. Classical MTS algorithms manage to improve computing efficiency by multi-stepping within DPD or CGMD for up to one order of magnitude of scale differential. In order to handle 3-4 orders of magnitude disparity in the temporal scales between DPD and CGMD, we introduce a new MTS scheme hybridizing DPD and CGMD by utilizing four different time stepping sizes. We advance the fluid system at the largest time step, the fluid-platelet interface at a middle timestep size, and the nonbonded and bonded potentials of the platelet structural system at two smallest timestep sizes. Additionally, we introduce parameters to study the relationship of accuracy versus computational complexities. The numerical experiments demonstrated 3000x reduction in computing time over standard MTS methods for solving the multiscale model. This MTS algorithm establishes a computationally feasible approach for solving a particle-based system at multiple scales for performing efficient multiscale simulations.},

@article{Kim2013,
abstract = {An integrative cell migration model incorporating focal adhesion (FA) dynamics, cytoskeleton and nucleus remodeling, actin motor activity, and lamellipodia protrusion is developed for predicting cell spreading and migration behaviors. This work is motivated by two experimental works: (1) cell migration on 2-D substrates under various fibronectin concentrations and (2) cell spreading on 2-D micropatterned geometries. These works suggest (1) cell migration speed takes a maximum at a particular ligand density (∼1140 molecules/µm(2)) and (2) that strong traction forces at the corners of the patterns may exist due to combined effects exerted by actin stress fibers (SFs). The integrative model of this paper successfully reproduced these experimental results and indicates the mechanism of cell migration and spreading. In this paper, the mechanical structure of the cell is modeled as having two elastic membranes: an outer cell membrane and an inner nuclear membrane. The two elastic membranes are connected by SFs, which are extended from focal adhesions on the cortical surface to the nuclear membrane. In addition, the model also includes ventral SFs bridging two focal adhesions on the cell surface. The cell deforms and gains traction as transmembrane integrins distributed over the outer cell membrane bond to ligands on the ECM surface, activate SFs, and form focal adhesions. The relationship between the cell migration speed and fibronectin concentration agrees with existing experimental data for Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell migrations on fibronectin coated surfaces. In addition, the integrated model is validated by showing persistent high stress concentrations at sharp geometrically patterned edges. This model will be used as a predictive model to assist in design and data processing of upcoming microfluidic cell migration assays.},

@article{Grechkin2016,
abstract = {We present a computational framework, called DISCERN (DIfferential SparsE Regulatory Network), to identify informative topological changes in gene-regulator dependence networks inferred on the basis of mRNA expression datasets within distinct biological states. DISCERN takes two expression datasets as input: an expression dataset of diseased tissues from patients with a disease of interest and another expression dataset from matching normal tissues. DISCERN estimates the extent to which each gene is perturbed-having distinct regulator connectivity in the inferred gene-regulator dependencies between the disease and normal conditions. This approach has distinct advantages over existing methods. First, DISCERN infers conditional dependencies between candidate regulators and genes, where conditional dependence relationships discriminate the evidence for direct interactions from indirect interactions more precisely than pairwise correlation. Second, DISCERN uses a new likelihood-based scoring function to alleviate concerns about accuracy of the specific edges inferred in a particular network. DISCERN identifies perturbed genes more accurately in synthetic data than existing methods to identify perturbed genes between distinct states. In expression datasets from patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), breast cancer and lung cancer, genes with high DISCERN scores in each cancer are enriched for known tumor drivers, genes associated with the biological processes known to be important in the disease, and genes associated with patient prognosis, in the respective cancer. Finally, we show that DISCERN can uncover potential mechanisms underlying network perturbation by explaining observed epigenomic activity patterns in cancer and normal tissue types more accurately than alternative methods, based on the available epigenomic data from the ENCODE project.},

abstract = {During vascular injury, platelets adhere to exposed subendothelial proteins, such as collagen, on the blood vessel walls to trigger clot formation. Although the biochemical signalings of platelet-collagen interactions have been well characterized, little is known about the role microenvironmental biomechanical properties, such as vascular wall stiffness, may have on clot formation. To that end, we investigated how substrates of varying stiffness conjugated with the same concentration of Type I collagen affect platelet adhesion, spreading, and activation. Using collagen-conjugated polyacrylamide (PA) gels of different stiffnesses, we observed that platelets do in fact mechanotransduce the stiffness cues of collagen substrates, manifesting in increased platelet spreading on stiffer substrates. In addition, increasing substrate stiffness also increases phosphatidylserine exposure, a key aspect of platelet activation that initiates coagulation on the platelet surface. Mechanistically, these collagen substrate stiffness effects are mediated by extracellular calcium levels and actomyosin pathways driven by myosin light chain kinase but not Rho-associated protein kinase. Overall, our results improve our understanding of how the mechanics of different tissues and stroma affect clot formation, what role the increased vessel wall stiffness in atherosclerosis may directly have on thrombosis leading to heart attacks and strokes, and how age-related increased vessel wall stiffness affects hemostasis and thrombosis.},

abstract = {The forces that arise from the actin cytoskeleton play a crucial role in determining the cell shape. These include protrusive forces due to actin polymerization and adhesion to the external matrix. We present here a theoretical model for the cellular shapes resulting from the feedback between the membrane shape and the forces acting on the membrane, mediated by curvature-sensitive membrane complexes of a convex shape. In previous theoretical studies we have investigated the regimes of linear instability where spontaneous formation of cellular protrusions is initiated. Here we calculate the evolution of a two dimensional cell contour beyond the linear regime and determine the final steady-state shapes arising within the model. We find that shapes driven by adhesion or by actin polymerization (lamellipodia) have very different morphologies, as observed in cells. Furthermore, we find that as the strength of the protrusive forces diminish, the system approaches a stabilization of a periodic pattern of protrusions. This result can provide an explanation for a number of puzzling experimental observations regarding cellular shape dependence on the properties of the extra-cellular matrix.},

Intra-vital microscopy of mixed GFP-red fluorescent protein (RFP) cell populations injected into the peritoneum demonstrated that cancer cells aggregate and attach as mixed spheroids, emphasizing the importance of homotypic adhesion in tumor formation. Electron microscopy provided high resolution structural information about local attachment sites. Experimental measurements from the mouse model were used to build a three-dimensional cellular Potts ovarian tumor model (OvTM) that examines ovarian cancer cell attachment, chemotaxis, growth, and vascularization. OvTM simulations provide insight into the relative influence of cancer cell-cell adhesion, oxygen availability, and local architecture on tumor growth and morphology. Notably, tumors on the mesentery, omentum, or spleen readily invade the "open" architecture, while tumors attached to the gut encounter barriers that restrict invasion and instead rapidly expand into the peritoneal space. Simulations suggest that rapid neovascularization of SKOV3.ip1 tumors is triggered by constitutive release of angiogenic factors in the absence of hypoxia. This research highlights the importance of cellular adhesion and tumor microenvironment in the seeding of secondary ovarian tumors on diverse organs within the peritoneal cavity. Results of the OvTM simulations indicate that invasion is strongly influenced by features underlying the mesothelial lining at different sites, but is also affected by local production of chemotactic factors. The integrated in vivo mouse model and computer simulations provide a unique platform for evaluating targeted therapies for ovarian cancer relapse.},

abstract = {Extracellular matrices composed of filamentous biopolymers like collagen and fibrin have viscoelastic properties that differ from those of rubberlike elastomers or hydrogels formed by flexible polymers. Compared to flexible polymer gels, filamentous biopolymer networks generally have larger elastic moduli, a striking increase in elastic modulus with increasing strain, and a pronounced negative normal stress when deformed in simple shear. All three of these unusual features can be accounted for by a theory that extends concepts of entropic elasticity to a regime where the polymer chains are already significantly extended in the absence of external forces because of their finite bending stiffness. An essential assumption of the theories that relate microscopic structural parameters such as persistence length and mesh size of biopolymer gels to their macroscopic rheology is that the deformation of these materials is affine: that is, the macroscopic strain of the bulk material is equal to the local strain within the material at each point. The validity of this assumption for the dilute open meshworks of most biopolymer gels has been experimentally tested by embedding micron diameter fluorescent beads within the networks formed by fibrin and quantifying their displacements as the macroscopic samples are deformed in a rheometer. Measures of non-affine deformation are small at small strains and decrease as strain increases and the sample stiffens. These results are consistent with the entropic model for non-linear elasticity of semiflexible polymer networks and show that strain-stiffening does not require non-affine deformations.},

abstract = {An integrative cell migration model incorporating focal adhesion (FA) dynamics, cytoskeleton and nucleus remodeling and actin motor activity is developed for predicting cell migration behaviors on 3-dimensional curved surfaces, such as cylindrical lumens in the 3-D extracellular matrix (ECM). The work is motivated by 3-D microfluidic migration experiments suggesting that the migration speed and direction may vary depending on the cross sectional shape of the lumen along which the cell migrates. In this paper, the mechanical structure of the cell is modeled as double elastic membranes of cell and nucleus. The two elastic membranes are connected by stress fibers, which are extended from focal adhesions on the cell surface to the nuclear membrane. The cell deforms and gains traction as transmembrane integrins distributed over the outer cell membrane bind to ligands on the ECM, form focal adhesions, and activate stress fibers. Probabilities at which integrin ligand-receptor bonds are formed as well as ruptures are affected by the surface geometry, resulting in diverse migration behaviors that depend on the curvature of the surface. Monte Carlo simulations of the integrative model reveal that (a) the cell migration speed is dependent on the cross sectional area of the lumen with a maximum speed at a particular diameter or width, (b) as the lumen diameter increases, the cell tends to spread and migrate around the circumference of the lumen, while it moves in the longitudinal direction as the lumen diameter narrows, (c) once the cell moves in one direction, it tends to stay migrating in the same direction despite the stochastic nature of migration. The relationship between the cell migration speed and the lumen width agrees with microfluidic experimental data for cancer cell migration.},

abstract = {Mechanosensing describes the ability of a cell to sense mechanical cues of its microenvironment, including not only all components of force, stress, and strain but also substrate rigidity, topology, and adhesiveness. This ability is crucial for the cell to respond to the surrounding mechanical cues and adapt to the changing environment. Examples of responses and adaptation include (de)activation, proliferation/apoptosis, and (de)differentiation. Receptor-mediated cell mechanosensing is a multistep process that is initiated by binding of cell surface receptors to their ligands on the extracellular matrix or the surface of adjacent cells. Mechanical cues are presented by the ligand and received by the receptor at the binding interface; but their transmission over space and time and their conversion into biochemical signals may involve other domains and additional molecules. In this review, a four-step model is described for the receptor-mediated cell mechanosensing process. Platelet glycoprotein Ib, T-cell receptor, and integrins are used as examples to illustrate the key concepts and players in this process.},

abstract = {In actin polymerization-based membrane protru-sions, the velocity of the protruding membrane decreases with increasing opposing force. This relationship, known as the force–velocity relation (FVR), can be concave up or con-cave down. However, the mechanism by which FVR exhibits two trends remains debatable. In this study, we simulate the Brownian dynamics of the protruding membrane driven by actin polymerization. The actin diffusion coefficient is retained constant, and the actin polymerization rates are set to low (case-L) or high (case-H). The protruding membrane in the case-L and case-H simulations exhibits a concave up and concave down FVR, respectively. The polymerization rate affects the spatial distribution of actins, and thereby their physical contact with the membrane. The membrane is pre-dominantly sustained by monomers in case-L and filaments in case-H. This suggests that membrane protrusions respond differently to the opposing force because actins are differ-ently distributed around the membrane.},

These publications have had an enormous influence on the progress of biochemistry, and are more often cited in the 21st century than they were in the 20th. Henri laid the groundwork for the understanding of enzyme mechanisms, but his experimental design was open to criticism. He reached essentially correct conclusions about the action of invertase, but he took no steps to control the hydrogen-ion concentration, and he took no account of the spontaneous mutarotation of the glucose produced in the reaction. Michaelis and Menten corrected these shortcomings, and in addition they introduced the initial-rate method of analysis, which has proved much simpler to apply than the methods based on time courses that it replaced. In this way they defined the methodology for steady-state experiments that has remained standard for 100 years.},

abstract = {This study demonstrates the validity of a mathematical model that predicts the force generated by rat skeletal muscles during brief subtetanic and tetanic isometric contractions. The model consists of three coupled differential equations (ODE's). The first two equations represent the calcium dynamics and the third equation represents force dynamics. The model parameters were identified from brief trains of regularly spaces pulses [constant-frequency trains (CFT's)] that produce subtetanic muscle responses. Using these parameters, the model was able to predict isometric forces from other stimulation patterns. For the gastrocnemius muscles predictions were made for responses to CFT's with interpulse intervals (IPI's) ranging from 10 to 50 ms and variable-frequency trains (VFT's), where the initial IPI = 10 ms and the remaining IPI's were identical to those used for the CFT's. For the soleus muscles predictions were made for 10-100-ms CFT's. The shape of the predicted responses closely match the experimental data. Comparisons between experimental and modeled force-time integrals, peak forces, and time-to-peak also suggest excellent agreement between the model and the experiment data. Many physiological parameters predicted by the model agree with values obtained independently by others. In conclusion, the model accurately predicts isometric forces generated by rat gastrocnemius and soleus muscles produced by brief stimulation trains.},

abstract = {During epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) progression, intraperitoneally disseminating tumor cells and multicellular aggregates (MCAs) present in ascites fluid adhere to the peritoneum and induce retraction of the peritoneal mesothelial monolayer prior to invasion of the collagen-rich submesothelial matrix and proliferation into macro-metastases. Clinical studies have shown heterogeneity among EOC metastatic units with respect to cadherin expression profiles and invasive behavior; however, the impact of distinct cadherin profiles on peritoneal anchoring of metastatic lesions remains poorly understood. In the current study, we demonstrate that metastasis-associated behaviors of ovarian cancer cells and MCAs are influenced by cellular cadherin composition. Our results show that mesenchymal N-cadherin-expressing (Ncad+) cells and MCAs invade much more efficiently than E-cadherin-expressing (Ecad+) cells. Ncad+ MCAs exhibit rapid lateral dispersal prior to penetration of three-dimensional collagen matrices. When seeded as individual cells, lateral migration and cell-cell junction formation precede matrix invasion. Neutralizing the Ncad extracellular domain with the monoclonal antibody GC-4 suppresses lateral dispersal and cell penetration of collagen gels. In contrast, use of a broad-spectrum matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) inhibitor (GM6001) to block endogenous membrane type 1 matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP) activity does not fully inhibit cell invasion. Using intact tissue explants, Ncad+ MCAs were also shown to efficiently rupture peritoneal mesothelial cells, exposing the submesothelial collagen matrix. Acquisition of Ncad by Ecad+ cells increased mesothelial clearance activity but was not sufficient to induce matrix invasion. Furthermore, co-culture of Ncad+ with Ecad+ cells did not promote a 'leader-follower' mode of collective cell invasion, demonstrating that matrix remodeling and creation of invasive micro-tracks are not sufficient for cell penetration of collagen matrices in the absence of Ncad. Collectively, our data emphasize the role of Ncad in intraperitoneal seeding of EOC and provide the rationale for future studies targeting Ncad in preclinical models of EOC metastasis.Oncogene advance online publication, 19 June 2017; doi:10.1038/onc.2017.171.},

To re-establish tissue integrity, epithelial cells exhibit coordinated motion into the void by active crawling on the substrate and by constricting a supracellular actomyosin cable. Coexistence of these two mechanisms strongly depends on the environment. However, the nature of their coupling remains elusive because of the complexity of the overall process. Here we demonstrate that epithelial gap geometry in both in vitro and in vivo regulates these collective mechanisms. In addition, the mechanical coupling between actomyosin cable contraction and cell crawling acts as a large-scale regulator to control the dynamics of gap closure. Finally, our computational modelling clarifies the respective roles of the two mechanisms during this process, providing a robust and universal mechanism to explain how epithelial tissues restore their integrity.},

PAS of 10 healthy donors provided [Ca(t)]i data for training 10 neural networks (NN, 2-layer/12-nodes) per donor. Trinary stimulations were then conducted at all 0.1x and 1xEC50 doses (160 conditions) as was a sampling of 45 higher ordered combinations (four to six agonists). The NN-ensemble average was a calcium calculator that accurately predicted [Ca (t)]i beyond the single and binary training set for trinary stimulations (R = 0.924). The 160 trinary synergy scores, a normalized metric of signaling crosstalk, were also well predicted (R = 0.850) as were the calcium dynamics (R = 0.871) and high-dimensional synergy scores (R = 0.695) for the 45 higher ordered conditions. The calculator even predicted sequential addition experiments (n = 54 conditions, R = 0.921). NN-ensemble is a fast calcium calculator, ideal for multiscale clotting simulations that include spatiotemporal concentrations of ADP, collagen, thrombin, thromboxane, prostacyclin, and nitric oxide.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis. Essentials: Platelet packing density in a hemostatic plug limits molecular movement to diffusion. A diffusion-dependent steep thrombin gradient forms radiating outwards from the injury site. Clot retraction affects the steepness of the gradient by increasing platelet packing density. Together, these effects promote hemostatic plug core formation and inhibit unnecessary growth. Summary: Background: Hemostasis studies performed in vivo have shown that hemostatic plugs formed after penetrating injuries are characterized by a core of highly activated, densely packed platelets near the injury site, covered by a shell of less activated and loosely packed platelets. Thrombin production occurs near the injury site, further activating platelets and starting the process of platelet mass retraction. Tightening of interplatelet gaps may then prevent the escape and exchange of solutes. Objectives: To reconstruct the hemostatic plug macro- and micro-architecture and examine how platelet mass contraction regulates solute transport and solute concentration in the gaps between platelets. Methods: Our approach consisted of three parts. First, platelet aggregates formed in vitro under flow were analyzed using scanning electron microscopy to extract data on porosity and gap size distribution. Second, a three-dimensional (3-D) model was constructed with features matching the platelet aggregates formed in vitro. Finally, the 3-D model was integrated with volume and morphology measurements of hemostatic plugs formed in vivo to determine how solutes move within the platelet plug microenvironment. Results: The results show that the hemostatic mass is characterized by extremely narrow gaps, porosity values even smaller than previously estimated and stagnant plasma velocity.

abstract = {Solid stress and tissue stiffness affect tumour growth, invasion, metastasis and treatment. Unlike stiffness, which can be precisely mapped in tumours, the measurement of solid stresses is challenging. Here, we show that 2D spatial maps of the solid stress and the resulting elastic energy in excised or in situ tumours with arbitrary shapes and a wide range of sizes can be obtained via three distinct and quantitative techniques that rely on the measurement of tissue displacement after disrup-tion of the confining structures. Application of these methods in models of primary tumours and metastasis revealed that (i) solid stress depends on both cancer cells and their microenvironments, (ii) solid stress increases with tumour size and (iii) mechanical confinement by the surrounding tissue substantially contributes to intratumoral solid stress. Further study of the genesis and consequences of solid stress, facilitated by the engineering principles presented here, may lead to new discoveries and therapies. I ncreased tissue stiffness is a widely accepted and actively studied biomechanical property of fibrotic tumours and has been linked to several hallmarks of cancer, including growth, metabolism, invasion and metastasis 1–7 . However, the abnormal mechanics of tumours are not limited to tissue stiffening. We recently demon-strated that solid stress represents a new mechanopathology that is consistently elevated in mouse and human tumours 8,9 . Solid stress is distinct from interstitial fluid pressure, as the former is contained in—and transmitted by—solid and elastic elements of the extracel-lular matrix and cells rather than fluids 10 . Therefore, tumours are not only more rigid than many normal tissues, but cancer cells also produce and are exposed to these physical forces. Composed of a combination of tension and compression, these forces are signifi-cant in tumours, but negligible in most normal tissues. Early evidence for the existence of solid stress in tumours came from the discovery that blood and lymphatic vessels are mechanically compressed 11–13},

Currently, a growing number of studies are unravelling the functional importance of signalling dynamics at the single cell level. In addition, first insights are emerging into how the principles of dynamic signal encoding apply to a multicellular context, such as development. In this review, we will first discuss general concepts of information transmission via signalling dynamics and recent experimental examples focusing on underlying principles, including the role of intracellular network topologies. How multicellular organisms use temporal modulation of specific signalling pathways, such as signalling gradients or oscillations, to faithfully control cell fate decisions and pattern formation will also be addressed. Finally, we will consider how technical advancements in the detection and perturbation of signalling dynamics contribute to reshaping our understanding of dynamic signalling in developing organisms.},

abstract = {Striated muscle contraction is a highly cooperative process initiated by Ca²⁺ binding to the troponin complex, which leads to tropomyosin movement and myosin cross-bridge (XB) formation along thin filaments. Experimental and computational studies suggest skeletal muscle fiber activation is greatly augmented by cooperative interactions between neighboring thin filament regulatory units (RU-RU cooperativity; 1 RU = 7 actin monomers+1 troponin complex+1 tropomyosin molecule). XB binding can also amplify thin filament activation through interactions with RUs (XB-RU cooperativity). Because these interactions occur with a temporal order, they can be considered kinetic forms of cooperativity. Our previous spatially-explicit models illustrated that mechanical forms of cooperativity also exist, arising from XB-induced XB binding (XB-XB cooperativity). These mechanical and kinetic forms of cooperativity are likely coordinated during muscle contraction, but the relative contribution from each of these mechanisms is difficult to separate experimentally. To investigate these contributions we built a multi-filament model of the half sarcomere, allowing RU activation kinetics to vary with the state of neighboring RUs or XBs. Simulations suggest Ca²⁺ binding to troponin activates a thin filament distance spanning 9 to 11 actins and coupled RU-RU interactions dominate the cooperative force response in skeletal muscle, consistent with measurements from rabbit psoas fibers. XB binding was critical for stabilizing thin filament activation, particularly at submaximal Ca²⁺ levels, even though XB-RU cooperativity amplified force less than RU-RU cooperativity. Similar to previous studies, XB-XB cooperativity scaled inversely with lattice stiffness, leading to slower rates of force development as stiffness decreased. Including RU-RU and XB-RU cooperativity in this model resulted in the novel prediction that the force-[Ca²⁺] relationship can vary due to filament and XB compliance. Simulations also suggest kinetic forms of cooperativity occur rapidly and dominate early to get activation, while mechanical forms of cooperativity act more slowly, augmenting XB binding as force continues to develop.},

@article{Gatsonis2014,
abstract = {A smooth dissipative particle dynamics method with dynamic virtual particle allocation (SDPD-DV) for modeling and simulation of mesoscopic fluids in wall-bounded domains is presented. The physical domain in SDPD-DV may contain external and internal solid boundaries of arbitrary geometries, periodic inlets and outlets, and the fluid region. The SDPD-DV method is realized with fluid particles, boundary particles, and dynamically allocated virtual particles. The internal or external solid boundaries of the domain can be of arbitrary geometry and are discretized with a surface grid. These boundaries are represented by boundary particles with assigned properties. The fluid domain is discretized with fluid particles of constant mass and variable volume. Conservative and dissipative force models due to virtual particles exerted on a fluid particle in the proximity of a solid boundary supplement the original SDPD formulation. The dynamic virtual particle allocation approach provides the density and the forces due to virtual particles. The integration of the SDPD equations is accomplished with a velocity-Verlet algorithm for the momentum and a Runge-Kutta for the entropy equation. The velocity integrator is supplemented by a bounce-forward algorithm in cases where the virtual particle force model is not able to prevent particle penetration. For the incompressible isothermal systems considered in this work, the pressure of a fluid particle is obtained by an artificial compressibility formulation for liquids and the ideal gas law for gases. The self-diffusion coefficient is obtained by an implementation of the generalized Einstein and the Green-Kubo relations. Field properties are obtained by sampling SDPD-DV outputs on a post-processing grid that allows harnessing the particle information on desired spatiotemporal scales. The SDPD-DV method is verified and validated with simulations in bounded and periodic domains that cover the hydrodynamic and mesoscopic regimes for isothermal systems. Verification of the SDPD-DV is achieved with simulations of transient, Poiseuille and Couette isothermal flow of liquid water between plates with heights of10 -5m and10 -3m. The velocity profiles from the SDPD-DV simulations are in very good agreement with analytical estimates and the field density fluctuation near solid boundaries is shown to be below 5{\%}. Verification of SDPD-DV applied to domains with internal curved solid boundaries is accomplished with the simulation of a body-force driven, low-Reynolds number flow of water over a cylinder of radius R = 0.02 m. The SDPD-DV field velocity and pressure compare favorably with those obtained by FLUENT. The results from these benchmark tests show that SDPD-DV is effective in reducing the density fluctuations near solid walls, enforces the no-slip condition, and prevents particle penetration. Scale-effects in SDPD-DV are examined with an extensive set of SDPD-DV isothermal simulations of liquid water and gaseous nitrogen in mesoscopic periodic domains. For the simulations of liquid water the mass of the fluid particles is varied between 1.24 and 3.3 ×107real molecular masses and their corresponding size is between 1.08 and 323 physical length scales. For SDPD-DV simulations of gaseous nitrogen the mass of the fluid particles is varied between 6.37 ×103and 6.37 ×106real molecular masses and their corresponding size is between 2.2 ×102and 2.2 ×103physical length scales. The equilibrium states are obtained and show that the particle speeds scale inversely with particle mass (or size) and that the translational temperature is scale-free. The self-diffusion coefficient for liquid water is obtained through the mean-square displacement and the velocity auto-correlation methods for the range of fluid particle masses (or sizes) considered. Various analytical expressions for the self-diffusivity of the SDPD fluid are developed in analogy to the real fluid. The numerical results are in very good agreement with the SDPD-fluid analytical expressions. The numerical self-diffusivity is shown to be scale dependent. For fluid particles approaching asymptotically the mass of the real particle the self-diffusivity is shown to approach the experimental value. The Schmidt numbers obtained from the SDPD-DV simulations are within the range expected for liquid water. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {In many biological systems, movement of an organism occurs in response to a diffusible or otherwise transported signal, and in its simplest form this can be modeled by diffusion equations with advection terms of the form first derived by Patlak [Bull. of Math. Biophys., 15 (1953), pp. 311--338]. However, other systems are more accurately modeled by random walkers that deposit a nondiffusible signal that modifies the local environment for succeeding passages. In these systems, one example of which is the myxobacteria, the question arises as to whether aggregation is possible under suitable hypotheses on the transition rules and the production of a control species that modulates the transition rates. Davis [Probab. Theory Related Fields, 84 (1990), pp. 203--229] has studied this question for a certain class of random walks, and here we extend this analysis to the continuum limit of such walks. We first derive several general classes of partial differential equations that depend on how the movement rules are...},

abstract = {Modeling of tumor growth has been performed according to various approaches addressing different biocomplexity levels and spatiotemporal scales. Mathematical treatments range from partial differential equation based diffusion models to rule-based cellular level simulators, aiming at both improving our quantitative understanding of the underlying biological processes and, in the mid- and long term, constructing reliable multi-scale predictive platforms to support patient-individualized treatment planning and optimization. The aim of this paper is to establish a multi-scale and multi-physics approach to tumor modeling taking into account both the cellular and the macroscopic mechanical level. Therefore, an already developed biomodel of clinical tumor growth and response to treatment is self-consistently coupled with a biomechanical model. Results are presented for the free growth case of the imageable component of an initially point-like glioblastoma multiforme tumor. The composite model leads to significant tumor shape corrections that are achieved through the utilization of environmental pressure information and the application of biomechanical principles. Using the ratio of smallest to largest moment of inertia of the tumor material to quantify the effect of our coupled approach, we have found a tumor shape correction of 20{\%} by coupling biomechanics to the cellular simulator as compared to a cellular simulation without preferred growth directions. We conclude that the integration of the two models provides additional morphological insight into realistic tumor growth behavior. Therefore, it might be used for the development of an advanced oncosimulator focusing on tumor types for which morphology plays an important role in surgical and/or radio-therapeutic treatment planning. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

We propose a molecular basis for the marked extensibility and negative compressibility of fibrin gels based on the structural and mechanical properties of clots at the network, fiber, and molecular levels. The force required to stretch a clot initially rises linearly and is accompanied by a dramatic decrease in clot volume and a peak in compressibility. These macroscopic transitions are accompanied by fiber alignment and bundling after forced protein unfolding. Constitutive models are developed to integrate observations at spatial scales that span six orders of magnitude and indicate that gel extensibility and expulsion of water are both manifestations of protein unfolding, which is not apparent in other matrix proteins such as collagen.},

Here, by characterization of the network structure with synchronous measurement of the fibrin storage and loss moduli at increasing degrees of compression, we show that the compressive behavior of fibrin networks is similar to that of cellular solids. A nonlinear stress-strain response of fibrin consists of three regimes: (1) an initial linear regime, in which most fibers are straight, (2) a plateau regime, in which more and more fibers buckle and collapse, and (3) a markedly nonlinear regime, in which network densification occurs by bending of buckled fibers and inter-fiber contacts. Importantly, the spatially non-uniform network deformation included formation of a moving "compression front" along the axis of strain, which segregated the fibrin network into compartments with different fiber densities and structure. The Young's modulus of the linear phase depends quadratically on the fibrin volume fraction while that in the densified phase depends cubically on it. The viscoelastic plateau regime corresponds to a mixture of these two phases in which the fractions of the two phases change during compression. We model this regime using a continuum theory of phase transitions and analytically predict the storage and loss moduli which are in good agreement with the experimental data. Our work shows that fibrin networks are a member of a broad class of natural cellular materials which includes cancellous bone, wood and cork.},

abstract = {We develop a mathematical model that describes key details of actin dynamics in protrusion associated with cell motility. The model is based on the dendritic-nucleation hypothesis for lamellipodial protrusion in nonmuscle cells such as keratocytes. We consider a set of partial differential equations for diffusion and reactions of sequestered actin complexes, nucleation, and growth by polymerization of barbed ends of actin filaments, as well as capping and depolymerization of the filaments. The mechanical aspect of protrusion is based on an elastic polymerization ratchet mechanism. An output of the model is a relationship between the protrusion velocity and the number of filament barbed ends pushing the membrane. Significantly, this relationship has a local maximum: too many barbed ends deplete the available monomer pool, too few are insufficient to generate protrusive force, so motility is stalled at either extreme. Our results suggest that to achieve rapid motility, some tuning of parameters affecting actin dynamics must be operating in the cell.},

abstract = {The dynamics of filopodia interacting with the surrounding extracellular matrix (ECM) play a key role in various cell-ECM interactions, but their mechanisms of interaction with the ECM in 3D environment remain poorly understood. Based on first principles, here we construct an individual-based, force-based computational model integrating four modules of 1) filopodia penetration dynamics; 2) intracellular mechanics of cellular and nuclear membranes, contractile actin stress fibers, and focal adhesion dynamics; 3) structural mechanics of ECM fiber networks; and 4) reaction-diffusion mass transfers of seven biochemical concentrations in related with chemotaxis, proteolysis, haptotaxis, and degradation in ECM to predict dynamic behaviors of filopodia that penetrate into a 3D ECM fiber network. The tip of each filopodium crawls along ECM fibers, tugs the surrounding fibers, and contracts or retracts depending on the strength of the binding and the ECM stiffness and pore size. This filopodium-ECM interaction is modeled as a stochastic process based on binding kinetics between integrins along the filopodial shaft and the ligands on the surrounding ECM fibers. This filopodia stochastic model is integrated into migratory dynamics of a whole cell in order to predict the cell invasion into 3D ECM in response to chemotaxis, haptotaxis, and durotaxis cues. Predicted average filopodia speed and that of the cell membrane advance agreed with experiments of 3D HUVEC migration at r2 {\textgreater} 0.95 for diverse ECMs with different pore sizes and stiffness.},

abstract = {Fibrin is a protein polymer that forms a 3D filamentous network, a major structural component of protective physiological blood clots as well as life threatening pathological thrombi. It plays an important role in wound healing, tissue regeneration and is widely employed in surgery as a sealant and in tissue engineering as a scaffold. The goal of this study was to establish correlations between structural changes and mechanical responses of fibrin networks exposed to compressive loads. Rheological measurements revealed nonlinear changes of fibrin network viscoelastic properties under dynamic compression, resulting in network softening followed by its dramatic hardening. Repeated compression/decompression enhanced fibrin clot stiffening. Combining fibrin network rheology with simultaneous confocal microscopy provided direct evidence of structural modulations underlying nonlinear viscoelasticity of compressed fibrin networks. Fibrin clot softening in response to compression strongly correlated with fiber buckling and bending, while hardening was associated with fibrin network densification. Our results suggest a complex interplay of entropic and enthalpic mechanisms accompanying structural changes and accounting for the nonlinear mechanical response in fibrin networks undergoing compressive deformations. These findings provide new insight into the fibrin clot structural mechanics and can be useful for designing fibrin-based biomaterials with modulated viscoelastic properties. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Filopodium, a spike-like actin protrusion at the leading edge of migrating cells, functions as a sensor of the local environment and has a mechanical role in protrusion. We use modeling to examine mechanics and spatial-temporal dynamics of filopodia. We find that {\textgreater}10 actin filaments have to be bundled to overcome the membrane resistance and that the filopodial length is limited by buckling for 10-30 filaments and by G-actin diffusion for {\textgreater}30 filaments. There is an optimal number of bundled filaments, {\~{}}30, at which the filopodial length can reach a few microns. The model explains characteristic interfilopodial distance of a few microns as a balance of initiation, lateral drift, and merging of the filopodia. The theory suggests that F-actin barbed ends have to be focused and protected from capping (the capping rate has to decrease one order of magnitude) once every hundred seconds per micron of the leading edge to initiate the observed number of filopodia. The model generates testable predictions about how filopodial length, rate of growth, and interfilopodial distance should depend on the number of bundled filaments, membrane resistance, lamellipodial protrusion rate, and G-actin diffusion coefficient. {\textcopyright} 2005 by the Biophysical Society.},

abstract = {Mitotic rounding during cell division is critical for preventing daughter cells from inheriting an abnormal number of chromosomes, a condition that occurs frequently in cancer cells. Cells must significantly expand their apical area and transition from a polygonal to circular apical shape to achieve robust mitotic rounding in epithelial tissues, which is where most cancers initiate. However, how cells mechanically regulate robust mitotic rounding within packed tissues is unknown. Here, we analyze mitotic rounding using a newly developed multi-scale subcellular element computational model that is calibrated using experimental data. Novel biologically relevant features of the model include separate representations of the sub-cellular components including the apical membrane and cytoplasm of the cell at the tissue scale level as well as detailed description of cell properties during mitotic rounding. Regression analysis of predictive model simulation results reveals the relative contributions of osmotic pressure, cell-cell adhesion and cortical stiffness to mitotic rounding. Mitotic area expansion is largely driven by regulation of cytoplasmic pressure. Surprisingly, mitotic shape roundness within physiological ranges is most sensitive to variation in cell-cell adhesivity and stiffness. An understanding of how perturbed mechanical properties impact mitotic rounding has important potential implications on, amongst others, how tumors progressively become more genetically unstable due to increased chromosomal aneuploidy and more aggressive.},

abstract = {A defining characteristic of living cells is the ability to respond dynamically to external stimuli while maintaining homeostasis under resting conditions. Capturing both of these features in a single kinetic model is difficult because the model must be able to reproduce both behaviors using the same set of molecular components. Here, we show how combining small, well-defined steady-state networks provides an efficient means of constructing large-scale kinetic models that exhibit realistic resting and dynamic behaviors. By requiring each kinetic module to be homeostatic (at steady state under resting conditions), the method proceeds by (i) computing steady-state solutions to a system of ordinary differential equations for each module, (ii) applying principal component analysis to each set of solutions to capture the steady-state solution space of each module network, and (iii) combining optimal search directions from all modules to form a global steady-state space that is searched for accurate simulation of the time-dependent behavior of the whole system upon perturbation. Importantly, this stepwise approach retains the nonlinear rate expressions that govern each reaction in the system and enforces constraints on the range of allowable concentration states for the full-scale model. These constraints not only reduce the computational cost of fitting experimental time-series data but can also provide insight into limitations on system concentrations and architecture. To demonstrate application of the method, we show how small kinetic perturbations in a modular model of platelet P2Y(1) signaling can cause widespread compensatory effects on cellular resting states.},

Research over the last few decades has identified many of the genes and signaling pathways involved in organizing the emergent multi-scale features of growth and homeostasis. However, an integrated model of organ growth regulation is still unrealized due to the numerous feedback control loops found within and between intercellular signaling pathways as well as a lack of understanding of the exact role of mechanotransduction. Here, we review several computational and experimental studies that have investigated the mechanical feedback hypothesis of organ growth control, which postulates that mechanical forces are important for regulating the termination of growth and hence the final physical dimensions of organs. In particular, we highlight selected computational studies that have focused on the regulation of growth of the Drosophila wing imaginal disc. In many ways, these computational and theoretical approaches continue to guide experimental inquiry. We demonstrate using several examples how future progress in dissecting the crosstalk between the genetic and biophysical mechanisms controlling organ growth might depend on the close coupling between computational and experimental approaches, as well as comparison of growth control mechanisms in other systems.},

During the former growth phase the tumour remains in a diffusion-limited, dormant state of a few millimetres in diameter (cf. multicell spheroids, carcinoma in situ) while during the latter growth phase, invasion and metastasis may take place. In order to accomplish the transition from avascular to vascular growth, solid tumours may secrete diffusible substances known as tumour angiogenesis factors (TAF) into the surrounding tissue. Endothelial cells which form the lining of neighbouring blood vessels respond to this chemotactic stimulus in a well-ordered sequence of events. Capillary sprouts are formed which migrate towards the tumour, eventually penetrating it and permitting vascular growth to take place. This paper will present several mathematical models which deal with the various stages of growth and development of solid tumours. Copyright {\textcopyright}1996 Elsevier Science Ltd.

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015 IEEE. Mechanical circulatory support (MCS) devices, such as ventricular assist devices and the total artificial heart, have emerged as a vital therapy for advanced and end-stage heart failure. However, MCS patients face life-long antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy to minimize thrombotic complications resulting from the dynamic and supraphysiologic device-associated shear stress conditions, whose effect on platelet activation is poorly understood. We repeatedly exposed platelets to average shear stresses up to 1000 dyne/cm 2 for as short as 25 ms in the 'platelet hammer,' a syringe-capillary viscometer. Platelet activation state was measured using a modified prothrombinase assay and morphological changes analyzed using scanning electron microscopy. An increase in stress accumulation (SA), the product of shear stress and exposure time, led to an increase in the platelet activation state and post-high shear platelet activation rate, or sensitization. A significant increase in platelet activation state was observed beyond an SA of 1500 dyne-s/cm 2 , with a marked increase in pseudopod length visible beyond an SA of 1000 dyne-s/cm 2 . The platelet hammer may be used to study other shear-dependent pathologies and may ultimately enhance the safety and effectiveness of MCS devices and objective antithrombotic pharmacotherapy management.},

Because of these properties and the ease of polymerization of the material, fibrin has been widely utilized as a biomaterial for over a century. Modifying the macroscopic properties of fibrin, such as elasticity and porosity, has been somewhat elusive until recently, yet with a molecular-level rational design approach it can now be somewhat easily modified through alterations of molecular interactions key to the protein's polymerization process. This review outlines the biochemistry of fibrin and discusses methods for modification of molecular interactions and their application to fibrin based biomaterials. {\textcopyright} 2013 Acta Materialia Inc.},

abstract = {Simulating cancer behavior across multiple biological scales in space and time, i.e., multiscale cancer modeling, is increasingly being recognized as a powerful tool to refine hypotheses, focus experiments, and enable more accurate predictions. A growing number of examples illustrate the value of this approach in providing quantitative insights in the initiation, progression, and treatment of cancer. In this review, we introduce the most recent and important multiscale cancer modeling works that have successfully established a mechanistic link between different biological scales. Biophysical, biochemical, and biomechanical factors are considered in these models. We also discuss innovative, cutting-edge modeling methods that are moving predictive multiscale cancer modeling toward clinical application. Furthermore, because the development of multiscale cancer models requires a new level of collaboration among scientists from a variety of fields such as biology, medicine, physics, mathematics, engineering, and computer science, an innovative Web-based infrastructure is needed to support this growing community.},

abstract = {Adaptive therapy (AT) aims to control tumour burden by maintaining therapy-sensitive cells to exploit their competition with resistant cells. This relies on the assumption that resistant cells have impaired cellular fitness. Here, using a model of resistance to a pharmacological cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor (CDKi), we show that this assumption is valid when competition between cells is spatially structured. We generate CDKi-resistant cancer cells and find that they have reduced proliferative fitness and stably rewired cell cycle control pathways. Low-dose CDKi outperforms high-dose CDKi in controlling tumour burden and resistance in tumour spheroids, but not in monolayer culture. Mathematical modelling indicates that tumour spatial structure amplifies the fitness penalty of resistant cells, and identifies their relative fitness as a critical determinant of the clinical benefit of AT. Our results justify further investigation of AT with kinase inhibitors.},

The quantitative study of cellular response upon contact relies on cell-to-cell collision, which rarely occurs in conventional cell culture. Herein, we developed a strategy to activate a robust cell-to-cell collision within smooth muscle cell pairs. Nanomechanical traction force mapping reveals that the collision process is promoted by the oscillatory modulations between contraction and relaxation and orientated by the filopodial bridge composed of nanosized contractile machinery. This strategy can enhance the occurrence of cell-to-cell collision, which renders it advantageous over traditional methods that utilize micropatterned coating to confine cell pairs. Furthermore, modulation of the balance between cell tugging force and traction force can determine the repolarization of cells and thus the direction of cell migration.

abstract = {A fundamental issue in locomotion is to understand how muscle forcing produces apparently complex deformation kinematics leading to movement of animals like undulatory swimmers. The question of whether complicated muscle forcing is required to create the observed deformation kinematics is central to the understanding of how animals control movement. In this work, a forced damped oscillation framework is applied to a chain-link model for undulatory swimming to understand how forcing leads to deformation and movement. A unified understanding of swimming, caused by muscle contractions ("active" swimming) or by forces imparted by the surrounding fluid ("passive" swimming), is obtained. We show that the forcing triggers the first few deformation modes of the body, which in turn cause the translational motion. We show that relatively simple forcing patterns can trigger seemingly complex deformation kinematics that lead to movement. For given muscle activation, the forcing frequency relative to the natural frequency of the damped oscillator is important for the emergent deformation characteristics of the body. The proposed approach also leads to a qualitative understanding of optimal deformation kinematics for fast swimming. These results, based on a chain-link model of swimming, are confirmed by fully resolved computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations. Prior results from the literature on the optimal value of stiffness for maximum speed are explained.},

To elucidate the mechanical nature of this process, we developed a model that combines an active contractile motor element with passive viscoelastic elements. Despite its importance for thrombosis and wound healing, clot contraction is poorly understood. This model predicts how clot contraction occurs due to active contractile platelets interacting with a viscoelastic material, rather than to the poroelastic nature of fibrin, and explains the observed dynamics of clot size, ultrastructure, and measured forces. Mechanically passive erythrocytes and fibrin are present in series and parallel to active contractile cells. This mechanical interplay induces compressive and tensile resistance, resulting in increased contractile force and a reduced extent of contraction in the presence of erythrocytes. This experimentally validated model provides the fundamental mechanical basis for understanding contraction of blood clots.},

abstract = {More and more frequently, computational biomechanics deals with problems where the portion of physical reality to be modeled spans over such a large range of spatial and temporal dimensions, that it is impossible to represent it as a single space-time continuum. We are forced to consider multiple space-time continua, each representing the phenomenon of interest at a characteristic space-time scale. Multiscale models describe a complex process across multiple scales, and account for how quantities transform as we move from one scale to another. This review offers a set of definitions for this emerging field, and provides a brief summary of the most recent developments on multiscale modeling in biomechanics. Of all possible perspectives, we chose that of the modeling intent, which vastly affect the nature and the structure of each research activity. To the purpose we organized all papers reviewed in three categories: 'causal confirmation,' where multiscale models are used as materializations of the causation theories; 'predictive accuracy,' where multiscale modeling is aimed to improve the predictive accuracy; and 'determination of effect,' where multiscale modeling is used to model how a change at one scale manifests in an effect at another radically different space-time scale. Consistent with how the volume of computational biomechanics research is distributed across application targets, we extensively reviewed papers targeting the musculoskeletal and the cardiovascular systems, and covered only a few exemplary papers targeting other organ systems. The review shows a research subdomain still in its infancy, where causal confirmation papers remain the most common.

Here, we unveil and quantify the structural mechanisms of clot contraction at the level of single platelets. A key elementary step of contraction is sequential extension-retraction of platelet filopodia attached to fibrin fibers. In contrast to other cell-matrix systems in which cells migrate along fibers, the "hand-over-hand" longitudinal pulling causes shortening and bending of platelet-attached fibers, resulting in formation of fiber kinks. When attached to multiple fibers, platelets densify the fibrin network by pulling on fibers transversely to their longitudinal axes. Single platelets and aggregates use actomyosin contractile machinery and integrin-mediated adhesion to remodel the extracellular matrix, inducing compaction of fibrin into bundled agglomerates tightly associated with activated platelets. The revealed platelet-driven mechanisms of blood clot contraction demonstrate an important new biological application of cell motility principles.},

@article{Bowne-Anderson2015,
abstract = {Recent studies have found that microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) can regulate the dynamical properties of microtubules in unexpected ways. For most MAPs, there is an inverse relationship between their effects on the speed of growth and the frequency of catastrophe, the conversion of a growing microtubule to a shrinking one. Such a negative correlation is predicted by the standard GTP-cap model, which posits that catastrophe is due to loss of a stabilizing cap of GTP-tubulin at the end of a growing microtubule. However, many other MAPs, notably Kinesin-4 and combinations of EB1 with XMAP215, contradict this general rule. In this review, we show that a more nuanced, but still simple, GTP-cap model, can account for the diverse regulatory activities of MAPs. The standard GTP-cap model of microtubule dynamics predicts that faster growing microtubules have a larger stabilizing cap, which results in a lower catastrophe frequency. Recent studies show that for many microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) this inverse relationship between growth and catastrophe breaks down.MAPs whose effects on microtubule dynamics do not accord with the standard GTP-cap model include XMAP215, kinesin-8, EB1, and kinesin-4.GTP-cap models in which hydrolysis cannot occur in the GTP-tubulin subunits at the end of the protofilaments (i.e., hydrolysis is coupled to polymerization) but does occur stochastically in the lattice (i.e., random hydrolysis) account for the observed effects of MAPs on microtubule dynamics.},

Ng, Simulating flow of DNA suspension using dissipative particle dynamics, Physics of Fluids 18 (6) (2006) 063102] has allowed DPD simulations of polymers for realistic values of the Schmidt number. However, DPD and its extensions encounter difficulties in simulating even simple fluids in wall-bounded domains. The two main problems are wall boundary conditions and compressibility effects - the topic of the present work - which limit the application of DPD to low Reynolds number (Re) flows (e.g., Re {\textless} 100). Here, we establish an empirical criterion that provides an upper limit in velocity and correspondingly in Re for a fixed computational domain, assuming a deviation from Navier-Stokes solutions of at most 5{\%}. This limit could be increased by increasing the size of the computational domain at approximately linear computational cost. Results are presented for the lid-driven cavity flow reaching, for first time, Re = 1000, and similar extensions can be established for other complex-geometry flows. A systematic investigation is presented with respect to both different types of boundary conditions and compressibility effects for the standard DPD method as well as the modified version that simulates highly viscous fluids. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {We present a study of the coarse-graining of polymers into bead-spring chains using statistical mechanics. The force-extension behavior is examined at different levels of coarse-graining. A direct result of the springs being decoupled is that the force-extension behavior depends only on the number of flexibility lengths (e.g. persistence or Kuhn lengths) represented by each spring. This dimensionless parameter is found to govern the fluctuations around the mean extension, analogous to the conventional role of temperature. The use of an effective flexibility length to correct the model behavior is analyzed, and we have calculated bounds on the choices of this correction factor. The analytic nature of the statistical mechanical framework has also allowed for the calculation of asymptotic and universal behavior. The zero Weissenberg number rheological behavior is examined using the retarded-motion expansion coefficients of bead-spring chains at different levels of coarse-graining. The results show the trade-off between using too few or too many springs. The general framework to analyze the force-extension and rheological behavior is applied to the worm-like chain, FENE, and Fraenkel models. We introduce a new method for coarse-graining a polymer into a bead-spring chain called the Polymer Ensemble Transformation (PET) method. Application to the freely jointed chain polymer yields a set of spring force-laws called the Random Walk Spring (RWS) model. This new method illustrates why the previous spring force-laws cannot be used to finely discretize polymers and also provides new insight into how to rationally proceed in the coarse-graining of polymers into bead-spring chains. {\textcopyright} Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Platelets interact with fibrin polymers to form blood clots at sites of vascular injury. Bulk studies have shown clots to be active materials, with platelet contraction driving the retraction and stiffening of clots. However, neither the dynamics of single-platelet contraction nor the strength and elasticity of individual platelets, both of which are important for understanding clot material properties, have been directly measured. Here we use atomic force microscopy to measure the mechanics and dynamics of single platelets. We find that platelets contract nearly instantaneously when activated by contact with fibrinogen and complete contraction within 15 min. Individual platelets can generate an average maximum contractile force of 29 nN and form adhesions stronger than 70 nN. Our measurements show that when exposed to stiffer microenvironments, platelets generated higher stall forces, which indicates that platelets may be able to contract heterogeneous clots more uniformly. The high elasticity of individual platelets, measured to be 10 kPa after contraction, combined with their high contractile forces, indicates that clots may be stiffened through direct reinforcement by platelets as well as by strain stiffening of fibrin under tension due to platelet contraction. These results show how the mechanosensitivity and mechanics of single cells can be used to dynamically alter the material properties of physiologic systems.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Ovarian cancer kills approximately 15,000 women in the United States every year, and more than 140,000 women worldwide. Most deaths from ovarian cancer are caused by tumors of the serous histological type, which are rarely diagnosed before the cancer has spread. Rational design of a potentially life-saving early detection and intervention strategy requires understanding the lesions we must detect in order to prevent lethal progression. Little is known about the natural history of lethal serous ovarian cancers before they become clinically apparent. We can learn about this occult period by studying the unsuspected serous cancers that are discovered in a small fraction of apparently healthy women who undergo prophylactic bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (PBSO). METHODS AND FINDINGS: We developed models for the growth, progression, and detection of occult serous cancers on the basis of a comprehensive analysis of published data on serous cancers discovered by PBSO in BRCA1 mutation carriers. Our analysis yielded several critical insights into the early natural history of serous ovarian cancer. First, these cancers spend on average more than 4 y as in situ, stage I, or stage II cancers and approximately 1 y as stage III or IV cancers before they become clinically apparent. Second, for most of the occult period, serous cancers are less than 1 cm in diameter, and not visible on gross examination of the ovaries and Fallopian tubes. Third, the median diameter of a serous ovarian cancer when it progresses to an advanced stage (stage III or IV) is about 3 cm. Fourth, to achieve 50{\%} sensitivity in detecting tumors before they advance to stage III, an annual screen would need to detect tumors of 1.3 cm in diameter; 80{\%} detection sensitivity would require detecting tumors less than 0.4 cm in diameter. Fifth, to achieve a 50{\%} reduction in serous ovarian cancer mortality with an annual screen, a test would need to detect tumors of 0.5 cm in diameter. CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis has formalized essential conditions for successful early detection of serous ovarian cancer. Although the window of opportunity for early detection of these cancers lasts for several years, developing a test sufficiently sensitive and specific to take advantage of that opportunity will be a challenge. We estimated that the tumors we would need to detect to achieve even 50{\%} sensitivity are more than 200 times smaller than the clinically apparent serous cancers typically used to evaluate performance of candidate biomarkers; none of the biomarker assays reported to date comes close to the required level of performance. Overcoming the signal-to-noise problem inherent in detection of tiny tumors will likely require discovery of truly cancer-specific biomarkers or development of novel approaches beyond traditional blood protein biomarkers. While this study was limited to ovarian cancers of serous histological type and to those arising in BRCA1 mutation carriers specifically, we believe that the results are relevant to other hereditary serous cancers and to sporadic ovarian cancers. A similar approach could be applied to other cancers to aid in defining their early natural history and to guide rational design of an early detection strategy.},

abstract = {During clotting under flow, platelets bind and activate on collagen and release autocrinic factors such as ADP and thromboxane, while tissue factor (TF) on the damaged wall leads to localized thrombin generation. Towards patient-specific simulation of thrombosis, a multiscale approach was developed to account for: platelet signalling [neural network (NN) trained by pairwise agonist scanning (PAS), PAS-NN], platelet positions (lattice kinetic Monte Carlo, LKMC), wall-generated thrombin and platelet-released ADP/thromboxane convection-diffusion (partial differential equation, PDE) and flow over a growing clot (lattice Boltzmann). LKMC included shear-driven platelet aggregate restructuring. The PDEs for thrombin, ADP and thromboxane were solved by finite element method using cell activation-driven adaptive triangular meshing. At all times, intracellular calcium was known for each platelet by PAS-NN in response to its unique exposure to local collagen, ADP, thromboxane and thrombin. When compared with microfluidic experiments of human blood clotting on collagen/TF driven by constant pressure drop, the model accurately predicted clot morphology and growth with time. In experiments and simulations at TF at 0.1 and 10 molecule-TF/[Formula: see text]m[Formula: see text] and initial wall shear rate of 200 s[Formula: see text], the occlusive blockade of flow for a 60-[Formula: see text]m channel occurred relatively abruptly at 600 and 400 s, respectively (with no occlusion at zero TF). Prior to occlusion, intrathrombus concentrations reached 50 nM thrombin, {\~{}} 1 [Formula: see text]M thromboxane and {\~{}} 10 [Formula: see text]M ADP, while the wall shear rate on the rough clot peaked at {\~{}} 1000-2000 s[Formula: see text] Additionally, clotting on TF/collagen was accurately simulated for modulators of platelet cyclooxygenase-1, P2Y[Formula: see text] and IP-receptor. This multiscale approach facilitates patient-specific simulation of thrombosis under hemodynamic and pharmacological conditions.},

abstract = {As the amount of biological data in the public domain grows, so does the range of modeling and analysis techniques employed in systems biology. In recent years, a number of theoretical computer science developments have enabled modeling methodology to keep pace. The growing interest in systems biology in executable models and their analysis has necessitated the borrowing of terms and methods from computer science, such as formal analysis, model checking, static analysis, and runtime verification. Here, we discuss the most important and exciting computational methods and tools currently available to systems biologists. We believe that a deeper understanding of the concepts and theory highlighted in this review will produce better software practice, improved investigation of complex biological processes, and even new ideas and better feedback into computer science.},
